# CloudFlare plugin for PencilBlue
A [PencilBlue](https://pencilblue.org/) plugin to automatically clear cached objects from [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) when they are updated or deleted.

**Usage:**

After installing the plugin, go into the plugin settings and enter your CloudFlare account's email address and API key. These can be found in the CloudFlare account console under Account Settings.

After the plugin has been configured, all updates or deletes of non-draft articles and pages will result in the cache being cleared for the article or page URL. The first save of a new article will result in the site index page cache being cleared.

All cache actions performed by the plugin will be logged to the default PencilBlue log.

**Limitations:**

- Article, page and site index URLs generated by the plugin and sent to CloudFlare are based on the default PencilBlue URL structure. If your site is using custom routes for any of these pages then you would also need to customize the CloudFlare plugin. Look for future versions of the plugin to allow configuration of the URLs that are sent to CloudFlare.
- Look for future versions of the plugin to support clearing other site URLs such as the RSS feed.
